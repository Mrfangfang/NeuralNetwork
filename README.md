Neural Network

    Written in Python 3.5.2



This is a simple neural network, built for learning purposes.

It was inspired by a YouTuber (Daniel Shiffman): https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/

He programs in p5.js (JavaScript) and processing (Java).

I followed along with the video translating everything to Python.

I also included a sample drivery file that contains code for using a neural network to solve xor.
